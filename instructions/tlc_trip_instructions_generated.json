This allows a user to easily and efficiently modify a list without modifying the original array or creating a separate complex for loop. It also can be used to extract or transform specific properties from an object array into a separate array. This makes map functions efficient in processing a dataset or converting data to a different format. Additionally, the map function can be chained with other methods such as filter and sort to create different combinations of desired array outputs. By using the map function, developers can easily manipulate datasets and create custom outputs without mutating the original dataset."
